## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- Relative units

### What I learned

Psuedo elements to style bullet points

```css
ol li::marker {
    color: var(--brown-800);
    font-weight: var(--font-weight-o-medium);
}
```
Styling tables

Positioning techniques to create custom layouts for different device widths

### Continued development

I want to further sharpen my skills on flex and grid layouts, as well as, CSS styling. Then move onto frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Full Course](https://youtu.be/-G-zic_LS0A) - This helped me learn the fundamentals of CSS. I gained a deep understanding of the three pillars of responsive design - relative units, fluid layouts, and media queries.
